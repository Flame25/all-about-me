**Verse 1**  

> I wander through the quiet spaces,  
> Where thought meets sky, and curiosity traces  
> The hidden patterns in the world around,  
> Listening to whispers, where answers are found.

**Pre-Chorus**  

> I may stumble, I may fall,  
> Yet I rise, I heed the call.

**Chorus**  

> I carry my principles like lanterns in the dark,  
> Guiding my journey, igniting a spark.  
> Through shadow and storm, through calm and fight,  
> I shape my path, I reach for the light.

**Verse 2**

> I take on challenges, both small and grand,  
> Turning thoughts to action with careful hands,  
> Each step a lesson, each challenge a spark,  
> Illuminating corners that were once dark.


**Bridge**

> Itâ€™s not about being loud or first to shine,  
> But finding meaning, one choice at a time,  
> In every stumble, in every try,  
> I discover the strength I carry inside.

**Outro**

> I walk my path, both steady and free,  
> A mind exploring, a soul that sees,  
> In every breath, in all I pursue,  
> I live my principles, and remain true.
